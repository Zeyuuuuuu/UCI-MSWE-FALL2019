  <h1>The Spatial Module for Apache Lucene</h1>
    <p>
      APIs for geospatial indexing and querying. Dependencies for the spatial module are
      restricted to inner lucene modules only. That is, no third-party dependencies
      are allowed. The intent is to keep this module free of any integration or
      licensing issues that might arise as a result of depending on an external library.
      For adding or leveraging spatial features that require third-party libraries see
      the <a href="../spatial-extras/overview-summary.html">spatial-extras</a> package.
